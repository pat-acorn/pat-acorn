I'm currently learning web development via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) as well as [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) for scientific/statistical computing. I'm interested in academic workflows using [obsidian.md](https://www.obsidian.md), [zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and [pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org), TTRPG campaign management using obsidian.md and [FoundryVTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com), as well as playing around with my [home lab](htt'://www.reddit.com/r/homelab) for self-hosted projects.
